Assume that a programmer works at the office from 9am-5 pm. We have to take care of his health and remind him three things,

 - To drink a total of 3.5-liter water after some time interval between 9-5 pm.
 - To do eye exercise after every 30 minutes.
 - To perform physical activity after every 45 minutes.

Instructions:
   The task is to create a program that plays mp3 audio until the programmer enters the input which implies that he has done the task.

 - For Water, the user should enter “Drank”
 - For Eye Exercise, the user should enter “EyDone”
 - For Physical Exercise, the user should enter “ExDone”
 - After the user enters the input, a file should be created for every task separately, which contains the details about the time when the user performed a certain task.

Challenge:
 You will have to manage the clashes between the reminders such that no two reminders play at the same time.
 Use pygame module to play audio.
